                A Demo First, check out this demo of what we're going to create. Slowly scroll down the page, and notice how the navigation menu sticks to the top of your browser window, no matter how far you scroll. You can also play with source code; we'll be covering
                each part below, so you'll want to leave the code open and follow along. How It Works This effect is a combination of two different technologies. The first is the fixed CSS position property, which positions content relative to the browser
                window, regardless of the window's scrolling position. Here's a simple demo of fixed position (with source code). The Back to Education Center Home link in the bottom-right corner of this page uses fixed positioning, too. To make our menu
                "float," we'll be switching back and forth between fixed and static (the default for all elements in a page). The second technology is some JavaScript, with jQuery to make things simpler. We use jQuery to determine the vertical position
                of a given element, then detect when the window is scrolled past that element's position. Here's a demo of that effect by itself (with source code). Tip: If you're not familiar with JavaScript or jQuery, take a look at book #5 in our recent
                article, 7 Free eBooks that Should Line Every Web Professional's Digital Bookshelf. This crash course will get you up to speed in no time. Creating Our Own
